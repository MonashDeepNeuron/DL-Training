# MDN Dl-Training
Heyo everyone and welcome to Monash DeepNeuron's Deep Learning Training Course. This repository contains the source codes or notebooks for DL Training content.

At MDN we regularly work on a broad range of projects, and so it's extremely important for everyone to have a basic understanding of how deep learning works, and how to apply it. All you'll need is a basic understanding of PyTorch and we'll teach you the rest ðŸ˜€.

Although neural networks involve a lot of heavy-duty theory, we're hyper-conscious of how difficult and overwhelming deep learning can feel for a first-time noob (don't worry, we've all been there).

Hence, this time around we're heavily prioritising interactive and beginner-friendly content (no rocket science here ðŸ˜…).

If you're interested in deep learning and want to know how it works/how to use (like a pro) feel free to plunge through our workshops and accompanying exercises!

## Workshop Overviews
This year's training is broken down into 5 workshops, each with an accompanying tutorial/exercise.

The exercises can either be completed individually or in a small group (highly recommended).

The first 3 workshops are dedicated to basic concepts, with 1 advanced and 1 very relevant workshop afterwards:
1. Introduction to Deep Learning - 
2. Introduction to PyTorch - 
3. CNNs and Training Methods - 
4. Advanced Layers - 
5. Tuning LLms - 

## Useful Resources
As you go through our workshops there will be certain things we just... don't have time to elaborate on.
When this happens, we'll link to external resources which we find useful.

Note that for basic Python skills any tutorial series like [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlcnQQJK8SUjW_HiBWhZ_XOfCq9Hu0aeY) or [this](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/) should suffice.
